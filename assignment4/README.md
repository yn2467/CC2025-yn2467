### Assignment 4, a Pixel Burger Factory

#### My process:

I decided to make a pixelated burger facotry for my this week's assignment. I was playing an old Zelda game on GameBoy, seeing its extensive use of pixel art, I decide to recreate this within p5js.

I have a confess that I had simplified the burgers a lot in to layered structures like now. Since my brain is bruning out when working on the display() function, figuring out how will each burger display as wanted.

It was really confusing for me when I first self-learn(since I am not in class last week) using the class function. It was kinda a struggle when writing the display() function, assorting all layers of burgers together. I was drawing out a few rects at first, but it really turns out to be very weired. Until I realize I have to padded each layers a little bit to creat the layered effect to make the whole as looked as a burger.
For loop is also my weekness as well, I just feel like my brain is forgetting each variables and what each line of code means when I move on to the next line. 

I decide to use noise for some further cool effect since the whole process will look too steady and boring. It turns out pretty nice and I liked the final product.
