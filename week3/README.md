### Inclass Notes:

##### About the Colors:
a grayscale color is denoted as a number 0-255
an rgb color is denoted as 3 numbers (red green blue)
we can also use name of a color like "black" or "olive"
To make a rgba picker, use background("rgba(0,0,0)"); for an auto color picker.

##### A Variable:
eg: let circleSzie = 125
"let" is a keyword that allows you to declare a variable
in the example, a new variable is being created. 
called "circleSize" which is storing a number (125)
###### At any time inside the code, you can ReDefine the variable. Without using the word "let".
