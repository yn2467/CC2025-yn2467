### THE Solar Clock
#### Creation Process

This is a new paragraph.

This week is me really challenging myself with for loops and all comparison and definition symbols. 

I started this project with an idea of me really insterested in astronomy, and decided to creat a solar clock myself. 

I found myself not good in math so I decided not to go very deep in cos() and sin() functions. Therefore I simply used percentage of each planet that travels to calculated the exact position of each planet. 

The for loops are really frustrated me a lot. Since I use P (planet fixed revolve period) as my variable for total time traveled I found myself stuck 2 hrs for not having the "Y","D","Hr" value add up as expected. But its really worth for me myself to finally finish this project with a basic understanding of for loops. 

I wrote most of my notes whithin the code. Please check if needed. 

Very gald have done this prj.
