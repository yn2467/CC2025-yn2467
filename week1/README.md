# Week 1 notes
  
> ## "Social and community organizers who saw in social media a new, safe way for people to gather, voice their opinions, and effect bottom-up change are often recoiling at the way networked anonymity breeds mob behavior, merciless attack, and thoughtless responses." (page10)

Today’s internet has increasingly become a breeding ground for racism, hatred, and division. It’s like how people in cars can honk, cut others off, or steal parking spots without a second thought. Anonymity, once a small helper for free speech, has turned into a weapon for online violence and psychological murder. I feel both deeply disgusted and powerless in the face of this phenomenon. People close to me have fallen into severe anxiety and depression because of such behavior, while the evidence of the perpetrators’ crimes can be casually erased with a “delete” button. I believe changing this toxic online atmosphere is an urgent task.

> ## "Computers and networks finally offer us the ability to write. And we do write with them on our websites, blogs, and social networks. But the underlying capability of the computer era is actually programming, which almost none of us know how to do. We simply use the programs that have been made for us, and enter our text in the appropriate box on the screen. We teach kids how to use software to write, but not how to write software. This means they have access to the capabilities given to them by others, but not the power to determine the value-creating capabilities of these technologies for themselves." (page13)

I don’t deny that learning programming can bring great convenience to our understanding of many things in life. I can imagine that if my parents knew how to code, they might better understand why a webpage takes so long to load, why the TV sometimes fails to connect to Wi-Fi, or why their phone suddenly “freezes.” But I cannot fully agree with this viewpoint—as if everyone who drives a car should also learn how to build one (well, if that were the case, hardware markets selling car parts would probably be everywhere). Still, in today’s era of rapid—even extreme—digitalization, learning to program can equip us with a new kind of survival skill. It allows us to avoid situations where, for instance, we need an AI to automatically translate text but end up having to repeatedly tell it, “Please translate this for me.” Yet this does not mean that everyone who uses tools must also know how to create them.

Especially after the rise of AI, I have been terrified to discover that my own thinking is gradually becoming dull. Looking back at my chat history with GPT, I realized it has unconsciously become my spiritual mentor—one that is empathetic and reasonable. I would ask it how to reconcile with my girlfriend, how to become a better person, and even how to make bagels. And it often gives me an answer so sweet and satisfying that it feels complete. But we should never abandon thinking—absolutely not—because our true selves and the essence of being human reside in those conflicting thoughts within our minds. We cannot rely on a machine brain to make all our decisions for us; instead, we must approach every choice with greater caution, care, and deliberation
