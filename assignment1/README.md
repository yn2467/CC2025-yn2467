#### Process of the Week:

I started with the plain background and the biggest center triangle.

Then I head with the lower-left bottom shapes but found it really frustrating using only vertex. I wonder there *MUST* be a method that can allow to rotate shapes, since most of the shapes in my scene is rects and triangle.

I use the pop and push function ---- where I understands it as creating a new layer after each pop. This sets the foundation of me using the rotation function. I setup a specific width and length for different shapes, allowing me to control them in different shapes, then I make sure they are rotating with a center point(this is also how I define where they will be located). With everything setup, they are rotated a specific angle that are vried whithin different shapes.
